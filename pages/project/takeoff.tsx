              Originally My Full Sail Experience, Takeoff is a mockup community
              portal for students. For one of my design courses at Full Sail, I
              wanted to push myself with creating an app prototype that would
              help other students. A problem Iâ€™ve noticed at multiple
              institutions is a variety of portals and platforms for students
              for different areas, each with different calendars, message
              inboxes and such and I wanted to design a way to consolidate them
              and help with other life tasks like finding roommates and
              notifying students of upcoming meetings and classes.

              This project had many design iterations and names. It focused on
              style guide creation, user testing, and rapid prototyping. Each
              week over a month, two presentations were expected showcasing
              competitive analysis, user feedback and a fast turnaround on
              design improvements with as little as an hour.

            <h2>Earlier prototypes</h2>
            <p>
              My first approach was to create a basic app with a hamburger menu,
              showing all of the options, it provided quite a bit of
              flexibility, but getting users to explore each area of the app was
              a bit difficult. Also, users felt the interface seemed a bit dark.
              In some of my later iterations, I opted for more of an
              onboard-heavy flow, however with this sacrificed much control by
              the users.

              Yes, you can actually play with these prototypes! They are just
              that, prototypes, to illustrate interface concepts, not working
              versions.

            <p>
              It turns out some of my earlier concepts were rather spot-on, and
              as I began changing minor details, it became faster to use SASS
              and HTML to implement these changes. I ended up also working with
              the Materialize CSS framework to help speed things up.
